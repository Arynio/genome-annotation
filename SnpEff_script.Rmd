#Search for the Lynx pardinus database
Step 1. Search for the Lynx pardinus assembly database in the program's pre-built database. As of June the 6th, 2017, the Lynx pardinus genome isn't included in the snpEff database. Once the snpEff authors include it, a newer version of the database should be downloaded (ask the tech group). A second option would be building our own Lynx pardinus database, although it seems complicated.

```{r Search for the Lynx pardinus database, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}

java -jar /opt/snpEff/snpEff.jar databases | grep -i pardinus

```

#S
Step 2. 

```{r Search for the Lynx pardinus database, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}



```
